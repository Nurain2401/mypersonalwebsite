		<p>In 2018, while waiting for an offer of admission to a public university for diploma studies, I had the chance to be a young teacher in a tuition class for junior students who want to take SPM at my school where I teach the subject of accounting. My account teacher asked me to help him in the extra class since I was not working at that time and had free time to help him. Being a teacher to juniors at school has many significant advantages. Most importantly, I was able to bridge the teacher-junior relationship, build a bond of trust and support, create an environment conducive to learning. Being a teacher provides an opportunity to understand the needs and potential of each individual student, supporting their development holistically. Not only that, contributing to junior education is an important contribution to the future of society, helping to form a knowledgeable and competitive generation. Overall, being a junior teacher not only provides an opportunity to teach, but also to shape and influence the lives of young students in a positive way.</p>

		<p>In 2019, when I received an offer to study at UniSZA in Terengganu, I joined the fire brigade where I participated in various organized programs.Joining the fire department at university during your studies provides many advantages, including the acquisition of safety and recovery skills such as firefighting and responding to chemical incidents. This involvement helps the development of personality and leadership through instilling the values of courage, discipline, and responsibility. High quality education and training in firefighting adds practical experience and is a valuable asset for career and life. In addition, involvement in this unit increases responsibility, and safety awareness in daily life, preparing individuals to act quickly and effectively in emergency situations. Overall, being part of a university fire department provides a holistic experience that integrates personal development, practical skills, community service, and heightened safety awareness.</p>

		<p>When I joined the fire brigade, we also held CSR activities where we visited orphanages around the Terengganu area. We divided the tasks to help clean the area of the orphanage as well as other activities. The job I got was to be a facilitator for the 5th grade students. We shared our experiences with them and we also gave them some motivation to raise their spirits to study hard.</p>
